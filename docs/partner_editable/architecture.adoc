Deploying this Quick Start with the default parameters builds the following {partner-product-short-name}
environment in its own virtual private cloud (VPC). For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstart/latest/vpc/welcome.html[Building a

image::../images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones.

* An internet gateway to provide access to the internet.*

* A certificate from the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) Secure Sockets Layer (SSL),
assuming that the supplied hosted-zone ID and DNS name are associated with the
Application Load Balancer.

* An Application Load Balancer that can either be internal or external facing.
* In the public subnets:
– Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources.
– A Linux bastion host to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to Amazon
Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances.

* In the private subnets:
– Auto Scaling groups that contain three, five, or seven {partner-product-name} server
instances across three Availability Zones.
– A {partner-product-name} environment with a https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/internals/integrated-storage[Raft storage] backend. {partner-product-short-name} uses the Raft
consensus algorithm to replicate data across the cluster.

* An AWS Secrets Manager secret that contains the root token and unseal keys created
during the {partner-product-name} cluster initialization.

* An AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key that is used to https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/autounseal-aws-kms[auto-unseal
{partner-product-name}] as well as encrypt the AWS Secrets Manager secret.
