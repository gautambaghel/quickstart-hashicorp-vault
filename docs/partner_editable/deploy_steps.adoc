=== Confirm your AWS account configuration

. Sign in to your AWS account at https://aws.amazon.com with an IAM user role that has the necessary permissions. For details, see link:#_planning_the_deployment[Planning the deployment] earlier in this guide.
. Ensure that your AWS account is configured correctly, as discussed in the link:#_technical_requirements[Technical requirements] section.

=== Subscribe to the {partner-product-short-name} AMI

This Quick Start requires a subscription to the AMI for {partner-product-short-name} in AWS Marketplace.

. Sign in to your AWS account.
. Open the page for the {marketplace_listing_url}[{partner-product-short-name} AMI in AWS Marketplace^], and then choose *Continue to Subscribe*.
. Review the terms and conditions for software usage, and then choose *Accept Terms*. +
  A confirmation page loads, and an email confirmation is sent to the account owner. For detailed subscription instructions, see the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/help/200799470[AWS Marketplace documentation^].

. When the subscription process is complete, exit out of AWS Marketplace without further action. *Do not* provision the software from AWS Marketplace—the Quick Start deploys the AMI for you.

=== Launch the Quick Start
// Adapt the following warning to your Quick Start.
WARNING: If you deploy {partner-product-short-name} into an existing VPC, ensure that your VPC has two private subnets in different Availability Zones for the workload instances and that the subnets are not shared. This Quick Start does not support https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-sharing.html[shared subnets^]. The subnets require https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html[NAT gateways^] in their route tables to allow the instances to download packages and software without exposing the instances to the internet. Also ensure that the domain name in the DHCP options is configured, as explained in http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html[DHCP options sets^]. Provide your VPC settings when you launch the Quick Start.

Each deployment takes about {deployment_time} to complete.

NOTE:  If you deploy HashiCorp Vault into an existing VPC, ensure that your VPC has two private subnets in different Availability Zones for the workload instances, and that the subnets are not shared. This Quick Start does not support https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-sharing.html[shared subnets]. To enable the instances to download packages and software without exposing them to the internet, the subnets require https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html[NAT gateways] in their route tables.

==== Sign in to your AWS account

. Sign in to your AWS account, and choose one of the following options to launch the AWS CloudFormation template. For help with choosing an option, see link:#_deployment_options[Deployment options] earlier in this guide.

. Check the AWS Region that's displayed in the upper-right corner of the navigation bar, and change it if necessary. This Region is where you build the infrastructure. The template is launched in the {default_deployment_region} Region by default. For more information, see link:#_supported_aws_regions[Supported AWS Regions] earlier in this guide.
NOTE: This deployment includes AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, which isn’t currently supported in all AWS Regions. For a current list of supported Regions, see the endpoints and quotas webpage.

. On the *Create stack* page, keep the default setting for the template URL, and then choose *Next*.
. On the *Specify stack details* page, change the stack name if needed. Review the parameters for the template. Provide values for the parameters that require input. For all other parameters, review the default settings and customize them as necessary. When you finish reviewing and customizing the parameters, choose *Next*.
. Create an http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[Amazon EC2 key pair] in your preferred AWS Region.
. If necessary, request a https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home?region=us-east-1#!/[service quota increase] for the Amazon EC2 *t3.medium* and *m5.large* instance types. You might do this if you already have an existing deployment that uses these instance types and you exceed the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html[default quota] with this reference deployment.

==== Subscribe to CIS Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS

This Quick Start recommends subscribing to the AMI for "CIS Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS Benchmark — Level 1" in AWS Marketplace.

. Sign in to your AWS account.

. Open the page for the *CIS Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS Benchmark — Level 1* AMI in AWS Marketplace, and then choose *Continue to Subscribe*.

. Review the terms and conditions for software usage, and then choose *Accept Terms*. A confirmation page loads, and an email confirmation is sent to the account owner. For
detailed subscription instructions, see the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/help/200799470[AWS Marketplace documentation].

. When the subscription process is complete, exit AWS Marketplace without further action.
