*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start. What should I do?

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, we recommend that you relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *Disabled*. (This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console, *Options* page.) With this setting, the stack’s state is retained and the instance is left running, so you can troubleshoot the issue. (Look at the log files in %ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService and C:\cfn\log.)

WARNING: When you set Rollback on failure to Disabled, you continue to incur AWS charges for the stack. Ensure to delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting.

For additional information, see Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation on the AWS website.

*Q.* I encountered a size limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* We recommend that you launch the Quick Start templates from the location we’ve provided or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a non-S3 location, you might encounter template size limitations when you create the stack.
